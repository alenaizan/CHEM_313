    "The hydrogen atom is the only atom for which the Schrodinger's equation can be solved exactly. We will introduce approximate methods that can be used for other atoms and molecules. The variational method and perturbation theory, introduced above, are particularly important approximation techniques. Furthermore, the concept of atomic orbitals, which is based on the solution of the Schrodinger's equation for the hydrogen atom, will be particularly useful for approximating the wavefunction for more complex systems."
