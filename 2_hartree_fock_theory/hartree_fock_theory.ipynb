    "## The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation\n",
    "Because of the interaction term between the electrons and nuclei $\\hat{V}_{eN}(\\textbf{r}, \\textbf{R})$, the Hamiltonian and in turn the wavefunction cannot be exactly written as a product of a nuclear and electronic part (i.e., $\\psi(\\textbf{r}, \\textbf{R}) = \\psi_{e}(\\textbf{r}) \\chi (\\textbf{R})$). However, nuclei are much heavier and slower than the electrons ($m_p \\approx 1800m_e$). Thus, electrons can quickly relax for any given nuclear configuration. The separation of the wavefunction to nuclear and electronic parts is therefore *approximately* correct. This is the essence of the **Born-Oppenheimer Approximation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a given *fixed* nuclear configuration $\\textbf{R}$. The $\\hat{T}_N(\\textbf{R})$ term will be zero and the $\\hat{V}_{NN}(\\textbf{R})$ term will be a constant. Additionally, the $\\hat{V}_{eN}(\\textbf{r}; \\textbf{R})$ term will only have a *parameteric* dependence on $\\textbf{R}$. Thus, we can define the electronic Hamiltonian as:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{H}_{e} = \\hat{T}_e(\\textbf{r})\n",
    "              + \\hat{V}_{eN}(\\textbf{r}; \\textbf{R})\n",
    "              + \\hat{V}_{ee}(\\textbf{r})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $V_{NN}(\\textbf{R})$ is often included in the electronic Hamiltonian. Given $\\hat{H}_{e}$, we can define the electronic Schrodinger's equation:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this equation will yield the electronic energy $E_{e}$. Quantum chemistry is largely concerned with developing approximate methods for solving the electronic Schrodinger's equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having solved the electronic Schrodinger's equation, we next proceed to finding the solution for the nuclear wavefunction $\\chi(\\textbf{R})$. Because the electrons move much faster than the nuclei, it is reasonable to assume that the nuclear motion will only experience the *average* effect of the electron interactions. Thus, we can define the nuclear Hamiltonian as follows:\n",

    "Given this nuclear Hamiltonian, we can define a nuclear Schrodinger's equation:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{H}_{nucl} \\chi = E \\chi\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the nuclear Schrodinger's equation gives the energy $E$, which is the energy in the original Schrodinger's equation $\\hat{H} |\\psi \\rangle = E |\\psi \\rangle$. It also yields the \n",
    "nuclear wavefunction $\\chi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation separates the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. $\\psi_{e}(\\textbf{r})$ describes the electronic energy levels for the molecule while $\\chi (\\textbf{R})$ describes the nuclear energy levels. The nuclear energy includes the contributions of vibration, rotation, and translation. Our focus will be on the electronic Schrodinger's equation."

    "## Electron Spin and Pauil Exclusion Principle\n",
    "To completely describe the electron, it is not sufficient to describe only its spatial coordinate. The electron also has a **spin** coordinate that can have one of two values: $\\pm 1/2$. The **Pauli exclusion principle** states that the wavefunction of fermionic systems (which have half-integer spins) must be *antisymmetric* with respect to the exchange any two particles. For electrons, this can be stated in a more familiar language as follows: No two electrons with the same spin can occupy the same orbital.\n",

    "The first observation that we can make is that for closed-shell atoms, the results of the three methods are identical. Relaxing the spatial constraint on the orbitals in UHF does not lead to a different solution from the restricted case. This is also generally true for molecules in their equilibrium geometries. However, in some cases, using UHF instead of RHF can lead to a better approximation of the energy, such as in bond dissociation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second observation is that the UHF energy is lower than or equal to the ROHF energy. Why is this the case? It is because of the variational principle. The Hartree-Fock method is variational. Thus, the relaxation of the spatial constraint introduces additional variational freedom that lowers the energy. This, however, happens at the expense of spin contamination. Minimizing the energy does not gurantee that other properties derived from the wave function are accurate."

    "#### Initial Guess\n",
    "Since the SCF procedue is iterative, a good initial guess can accelerate the convergence. There are various ways to guess the initial density or orbital coefficient matrix. The easiest way is to set the matrix to zero. This leads to the Fock matrix being equal to the core Hamiltonian. This is the **core** guess. This is usually a poor choice because it completely neglects electron-electron interactions. Other guesses include the **extended Huckel** guess and the **superposition of atomic densities (SAD)**, among others. It is also often fruitful to **read** the molecular orbitals from a previously converged calculations on a similar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accelerating Convergence\n",
    "Often, the SCF procedue will not converge or will converge slowly. Useful methods to accelerate the convergence are direct inversion of the iterative subspace (**DIIS**), which is an extrapolation technique. Other useful methods are the maximum overlap method (**MOM**), and **damping**, which are particularly useful when the SCF procedure is oscillating. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lowering the Scaling of the Hartree-Fock Method\n",
    "As mentioned above, the Hartree-Fock method scaled as $O(n^4)$. This can be lowered to $O(n^3)$ using techniques like **density-fitting** or **resolution-of-the-identity**. Furthermore, screening techniques can be used to neglect the interactions between basis functions that are far from each other, thus lowering the computational cost to $O(n^2)$."

    "In practice, Hartree-Fock calculations, even at the complete basis set limit, are not very accurate because of the neglect of electron correlation. The total energy is defined as the sum of the Hartree-Fock energy at the complete basis set limit and the energy of electron correlation:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E_0 = E_{HF} + E_{corr}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating accurate $E_{corr}$ is required for chemical applications. Therefore, many theoretical methods have been developed for its computation. Most of these methods build on the results of Hartree-Fock theory and therefore are called **post-Hartree-Fock** methods. These methods are generally more accurate than the Hartree-Fock method but they are computationally expensive. These methods, including Hartree-Fock, are called *ab initio* (from first principle) because they only depend on numerical approximations without fitting to experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **semi-empirical** methods seek to reduce the computational cost of the Hartree-Fock method by neglecting some 2-electron integrals and replacing them with parameters fitted to experimental data. This extends their applicability to large systems, but makes them dependent on the reliability of the fitting procedure."
