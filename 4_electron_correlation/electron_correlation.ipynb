    "# Electron Correlation\n",

    "Hartree-Fock theory provides a first approximation for the solution of the electronic Schrodinger's equation. However, Hartree-Fock theory is not exact even at the complete basis set limit. The difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy is called the **correlation energy**:\n",

    "How does Hartree-Fock theory neglect electron correlation? Remeber that, in fact, the Hartree-Fock trial wavefunction, the Slater determinant, accounts for *exchange correlation*, which arises from the Pauli exclusion principle. That is, electrons with the same spin are correlated while those with opposite spins are uncorrelated. The more approximate Hartree product neglects exchange correlation, and is a true independent particle model. Hartree-Fock theory is a mean-field theory that describes the interaction of an electron with the *average* charge density of all other electrons. The approximate nature of Hartree-Fock theory stems from the fact that it uses only a *single* Slater determinant as a trial wavefunction. Indeed, Hartree-Fock theory provides the *best* estimate of the energy given a single Slater determinant as the trial wavefunction, as guranteed by the variational procedure. Therefore, we can improve the energy by including additional Slater determinants in the trial wavefunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electron correlation is often divided into two types: dynamical, and static. **Dynamical correlation** accounts for the instantaneous correlated motion of the electrons, which is neglected in the mean-field approximation of Hartree-Fock theory. In **static correlation**, the Hartree-Fock single Slater determinant method fails to qualitatively describe the wavefunction, and *multi-reference* methods are required. This generally happens when the several Slater determinants have similar weights, which arises because of (near) degeneracies in the energy levels. We will first discuss dynamical correlation."

However, in higher excitation level methods, singly excited determinants can contribute to the correlation energy be mixing with other determinants, e.g. $\\langle \\Psi_a^r| H | \\Psi_{ab}^{rs} \\rangle $. Why does the Brillouni's theorem hold? Using Slater's rule, the matrix element between the Hartree-Fock determinant and a singly excited determinant is given by:\n",

    "It is not guranteed that including higher order perturbation terms will actually improve the energy. The perturbation in the Moller-Plesset method is the full electron-electron repulsion, which is quite large, and therefore the series is not guranteed to converge. Furthermore, the MP series is not variational. Unlike the truncated CI methods, for which the energy decreases as the excitation level increases, the MP series often displays oscillatory behavior. We show below an example of this behavior for the energy of the Ne atom. In practice, the MP2 method is widely used for computing electron correlation while higher order MP methods are used less often. Coupled cluster theory, which is discussed below, is generally preferred for performing more accurate calculations.\n",

    "## Multi-reference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, electron correlation is often divided into two types: static and dynamical. In static correlation, the Hartree-Fock single Slater determinant is not a good starting point upon which to improve the energy. This generally happens because of degeneracies in the energy levels. This applies to some molecules in their equilibrium geometries. Degeneracies also often arise from bond dissociation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for example the $\\pi$-orbitals of trimethylenemethane (TMM) shown below. From Hund's rule, it is expected that the triplet state is lower in energy than the singlet state. However, suppose that we are interested in the singlet state. Each one of the singlet configurations is a valid way for organizing the electrons. Now suppose a restricted Hartree-Fock calculation is carried out. Because Hartree-Fock theory is a single-reference method, only one of these determinant will be chosen, and the Hartree-Fock energy will be determined based on the occupied orbitals only. This is clearly not the correct description. We need a method that treats the two singlet configurations on equal footing. This is where multireference methods come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](TMM_orbitals.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In multireference methods, the occupied orbitals in each configuration are first selected. Then, the shapes of the molecular orbitals as well as the expansion coefficients are optimized during the self-consistent field procedure. For example, one starting point for the TMM system would be:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\Psi_{\\rm MCSCF} = c_1 |\\cdots \\pi_1^2 \\pi_2^2 \\rangle + c_2 |\\cdots \\pi_1^2 \\pi_3^2 \\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "However, because the $\\pi$ orbitals in conjugated $\\pi$ systems are often close in energy, it is better to include all the $\\pi$ orbitals in the expansion. Because we have four electrons that we want to distribute in four orbitals, this is called a (4, 4) calculation. The first number in this notation is the number of electrons and the second is the number of orbitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we distribute $m$ electrons in $n$ orbitals? The number of possible signlet configurations is given by:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    N = \\frac{n! (n+1)! }{(\\frac{m}{2})! (\\frac{m}{2}+1)! (n-\\frac{m}{2})! (n-\\frac{m}{2}+1)!}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n=m=4$, $N=20$. The number grows quickly as $n$ and $m$ increases. How do we decide on which of the possible determinants should we include in the expansion? Sometimes, chemical intuition can guide on choosing the most important determinants. For example, a reasonable starting guess for TMM would be:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\Psi_{\\rm MCSCF} = c_1 |\\cdots \\pi_1^2 \\pi_2^2 \\pi_3^0 \\pi_4^0 \\rangle + c_2 |\\cdots \\pi_1^2 \\pi_2^0 \\pi_3^2 \\pi_4^0 \\rangle + c_3 |\\cdots \\pi_1^2 \\pi_2^0 \\pi_3^0 \\pi_4^2 \\rangle + c_4 |\\cdots \\pi_1^0 \\pi_2^2 \\pi_3^2 \\pi_4^0 \\rangle \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "However, instead of picking and choosing based on a personal judgement, one can use *all* possible configurations. This is called the **complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)** method. The active space here refers to the electrons and orbitals chosen in the procedure. For example, for TMM, the active space represents the $\\pi$ orbitals and $\\pi$ electrons. If all the electrons and all the orbitals in the system are chosen, then CASSCF would be equivalent to full CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **restricted active space self-consistent field (RASSCF)** method limits the number of configurations and therefore is less computationally expensive than CASSCF. The active space is divided into three regions: RAS1, RAS2, and RAS3. The RAS2 space includes some of the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals, and the CASSCF method is implemented. On the other hand, only a subset of excitations (e.g. 0, 1, 2) are allowed from the occupied RAS1 space to the virtual RAS3 space. Furthermore, an additional approximation that lowers computational cost is to *freeze* some of the occupied and virtual orbitals. For these frozen orbitals, the shape is not reoptimized during the MCSCF procedure. The figure below illustrates the possible orbital roles in the MCSCF procedure.\n",

    "The above multi-reference methods are often not adequate for capturing *dynamical* correlation. Thus, often dynamical correlation is estimated using multi-reference truncated configuration interaction, multi-reference perturbation theory, or multi-reference coupled cluster theory."

    "## Performance of Hartree-Fock and Post-Hartree-Fock Methods\n",
    "We can define the error of a given method as the difference between the calculated value for a given property and the exact value computed with the nonrelativistic Schrodinger's equation. The exact value can in principle be calculated using the complete CI model. There are two sources of error in Hartree-Fock and post-Hartree-Fock calculations: (1) The use of an incomplete atomic orbital basis set; and (2) the incomplete accounting of electron correlation by neglecting some Slater determinants. It is often the case that these errors have opposite directions, and therefore favorable cancellation of errors can be leveraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the complete CI value is an unattainable theoretical quantity, we can use two approaches to evaluate the accuracy of a given method: (1) compare the predictions of the method with the best theoretical estimate available; and (2) compare the predictions with experimental data. Generally speaking, for small systems in the gas phase, theoretical predictions can often faithfully reproduce experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking studies that evaluate the accuracy of theoretical methods usually select a subset of molecules and compute the desired properties. Then, the errors in the method are reported using various statistical measures, such as the **mean absolute error** and the **maximum absolute error**. The physical quantities investigated can be energetic, structural, spectroscopic, etc., properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We report below the performance of various theoretical methods, reproducing the figures from the following reference: Helgaker, T.; Jorgensen, P.; Olsen, J. *Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory*, 1st ed.; John Wiley & Sons: Nashville, TN, 2014. The test set is 20 small organic molecules and the compariosn is with respect to experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the distribution in the bond length error (in pm). Generally speaking, the bond length decreases with the increase in the basis set size, and increases with the increase in the number of Slater determinants. Hartree-Fock theory underestimates the bond length and have broad error distributions. Increasing the basis set size does not improve the description. The MP2 and MP4 methods show a better performance than the MP3 method, which has a systematic error. The CCSD(T) shows the best performance overall, with a very narrow error peak for the cc-pVTZ and the cc-pVQZ basis sets. The cc-pVDZ basis set is generally inadequate.\n",
    "<img src=\"bond_length_error.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows the error in bond angle (in degrees). The errors in the bond length and bond angle are coupled. The shorter the bond length, the closer the atoms, and thus the greater the repulsion, and the larger the bond angle.\n",
    "<img src=\"bond_angle_error.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the following figure shows the distribution of reaction enthalpy errors (in kJ/mol) for a set of reactions at 0 K. The calculated enthalpies contain electronic and vibrational contributions. Again, the Hartree-Fock results show broad errors, while the CCSD(T) model again has the highest accuracy. \n",
    "<img src=\"reaction_enthalpy_error.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the above analysis is for a small sample of molecules and for only a few properties. Careful analysis and benchmarking of theoretical methods should always be performed in order to make reliable predictions with good estimation of the errors. "
