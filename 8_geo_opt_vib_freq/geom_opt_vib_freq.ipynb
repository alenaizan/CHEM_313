    "## Potential Energy Surfaces\n",
    "The potential energy surface is the potential energy of the molecule as a function of the various possible arrangements of the atoms. This concept is possible at the quantum level because of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation discussed before. The total number of degrees of freedom in a molecule with $N$ atoms is $3N$ because each atom has three Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). However, in the absence of an external field, the potential energy of the molecule does not change if the molecule is rotated or translated. Thus, the potential energy surface is a function of the *internal* coordinates. For a nonlinear molecule, there are three rotational degrees of freedom, while for a linear molecule there are only two. For both linear and nonlinear molecules, there are three translational degrees of freedom. Thus, the total number of internal degrees of freedom $3N-6$ for nonlinear molecules and $3N-5$ for linear molecules. These internal degrees of freedom can be enumerated, for example, in terms of the bonds, angles, and torsions of the molecules, but other representations are also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show the potential energy surface for the F$_2$ molecule computed at different levels of theory. Because this is a dimer, there is only one degree of freedom, which is the distance between the two atoms. We will calculate the energy at 25 different bond lengths."

    "We can notice a few things on the above plot. First, because there is a single degree of freedom, this is actually a curve not a surface. If there are two or more degrees of freedom, we obtain surfaces or hypersurfaces. For this reason, it is not possible to represent the full potential energy surface of a complex molecule visually in a plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second observation is that different methods give differnt potential energy surfaces. Not only are the *absolute* values of the energy are different, but so are the *relative* values. Thus, the shape of the potential energy surface is sensitive to the theoretical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important point in the potential energy surface is the **minimum**, which represents the most stable configuration of the molecule. Different theoretical methods can predict different minimum structures. For example, Hartree-Fock theory with the cc-pVDZ underestimates the equilibrium bond length for F$_2$ compared to MP2 and B3LYP. For comparison, the experimental value is 1.41 Angstroms.\n",

There are two parameters that define its geometry in the C$_{2v}$ symmetry, namely the distance from the two hydrogen atoms to the oxygen atom, and the angle between the three atoms. Let's explore the potential energy surface of H$_2$O around its minimum structure. We will perform a 100 energy evaluations. We will construct a grid of points with 10 bond lengths and 10 bond angles and calculate the energy at each of the grid points."

    "What do we see here? As expected, the linear water molecule is high in energy. As the angle is decreased below 180 degrees or increased above 180 degrees, the energy decreases. There is a **mimium energy path** that connects the two minimum points in the above plot. The maximum point along this minimum energy path is called the **transition state**. At the transition state, there is only one direction that minimizes the energy; all other directions increase the energy. The transition state is a saddle point. In a potential energy surface, there might be some higher order saddle points, which are minima in all directions except $n$ and maxima along $n$ directions, where $n>1$. The stationary points in the potential energy surface can be charachterized by the **Hessian index**. The **Hessian** is the second-order derivative of the energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates. The Hessian index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. It is equal to 0 for minima, 1 for transition states, and $n$ for a saddle point with order $n$. As discussed below, the Hessian index is also equal to the number of *imaginary* vibrational frequencies."

    "## Geometry Optimization\n",
    "Optimization refers to finding the minimum or maximum value of a function. As such, optimization applications are not limited to geometry optimization but can be extended to the optimization of any function. In the current context, we are interested in geometry optimization, that is finding the structure where the potential energy is minimum or maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we find the minimum energy structure? The simplest approah conceptually is to construct the complete potential energy surface and locate the minima. That is, we can calculate the potential energy as a function of one or more parameters. Obviously, this is not possible except for simple systems, such as the F$_2$ dimer discussed above, or when one is interested in one or few degrees of freedom. In such a case, all degrees of freedom can be considered *frozen* and a potential energy surface of reduced dimentionality is constructed. A better approach is of course needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Search\n",
    "Let's consider the F$_2$ example once again. Instead of constructing the complete potential energy surface, we can perform an iterative procedure to find the minimum. Starting from a a given bond length, we can increase or decrease the bond length by some amount and see if the energy decreases. If the energy decreases, then we continue in the same direction until the energy no longer decreases. The step size can be adjusted so that we do not overshoot the minimum. We also need to define a convergence criteria, for example, by requiring that the energy does not change by a greater than a given amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can carry out a similar process for optimizing systems with more degrees of freedom. For example, for CO$_2$, we can iteratively change the length of one C-O bond while holding the other fixed. Then, we can change the length of the other C-O bond while keeping the first one fixed. Then, the process has to be repeated for both bonds until there is no significant change in the energy. If the two degrees of freedom are coupled, the covergence of this scheme will be very slow. Thus, we need a faster method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steepest Descent\n",
    "Instead of changing the degrees of freedom indepedently, we can change the geometry in the direction with the greatest downward slope in the energy with respect to *all* coordinates. The gradient vector $\\textbf{g}$ points in the direction of the maximum increase in the function. Thus, we can lower the potential energy by stepping in the opposite direction to the gradient. The gradient of a potential energy function may be determined *analytically* or may be determined by *numerical differentiation*. Using analytical gradients is faster than using numerical gradients, because calculating numerical gradients requires evaluating the function values at several points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the gradient, we change all degrees of freedom in the opposite direction of the gradient using a given step size. If the step size is too small, the minimum will be approached very slowly. By contrast, if the step size is too large, the minimization may not converge. In general, the step size is allowed to vary. A good step size can be determined by the so-called **line search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking a steepest descent step, we calculate the gradient again and take another step. We repeat the process until we approach the minimum. Again, we use convergence criteria to terminate the minimization. If an optimum step size is chosen, the next steepest descent direction will necessarily be perpendicular to the last direction as depicted below. Thus, each steepest descent step partially undoes the gain obtained from the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"steepest_descent.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate the steepest descent algorithm below for geometry optimization of a water molecule. We will set the initial angle between the three atoms to 80$^\\circ$, which is smaller than the equilibirum. Then, we will perform a steepest descent minimization to optimize the geometry. At each geometry, we will calculate the energy and the gradient of the water molecule using Psi4. Then, we will update the geoemtry using the given gradient. We will use a fixed step size for simplicity. We will repeat the process until the energy converges. We will see that the energy decreases with the optimization and the H-O-H bond angle will approach the equilibrium value for the used theoretical method."

For example, at the stantionary state, the gradient should be zero, so we can check whether the maxium element of the gradient or the RMS value of the gradient is below a certain threshold. We can also check the convergence of the geometry, using for example the maximum displacement or the RMS displacemnt. \n",

    "\n",
    "For polyatomic systems, the harmonic oscillator approximation leads to a system of coupled differential equations if the Cartesian coordinate system is used. However, transforming the coordinates to a unique set of mass-dependent spatial coordinates $\\textbf{q}$ decouple the system of equation. Vibrations along the $\\textbf{q}$ coordinate system are called the **normal modes**. The number of vibrational modes in a molecule is equal to $3N-6$ for nonlinear molecules and $3N-5$ for linear molecules, where $N$ is the number of atoms. For example, for a diatomic molecule, there is only one vibrational mode. \n",

    "From the above equations, it is clear that in order to predict the vibrational motion, we only need to determine the force constant $k$. This can be determined from the Hessian, or the second derivative of the energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates. As mentioned above, the Hessian can be either determined analytically or numerically for a given level of theory. To estimate the vibrational frequency, it is critical that the level of theory frequency calculation is the same as the one used for geoemtry optimization. Different levels of theory can predict different stationary state geometries, and therefore it is useless to predict the geometry using one method and the frequency using another method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prediction of vibrational frequencies, it is often observed that certain levels of theory have systematic deviations from the experimental frequencies. For example, frequencies predicted using the HF/6-31G(d) level are often scaled down by over 10%, which substantially improves the agreement with the experimental data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vibrational transitions occur in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They can be probed with IR spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy. For a vibrational mode to be IR active, it needs to change the dipole moment of the molecule. Estimating the IR intensity requires taking mixed second derivatives of the energy with respect to geometric motion and with respect to an external electric field. Such a derivative may or may not be available for a given level of theory. For a vibrational mode to be Raman active, it needs to change the polarizability of the molecule. Predicting Raman intensities requires mixed third derivatives, which are difficult to compute.\n",

    "## Thermodynamic Analysis\n",
    "So far, we have been concerned with the properties of a *single* molecule. However, chemistry usually deals with a huge number of molecules. One mole is equal to $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$. Statistical mechanics makes the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical mechanics, an ensemble is a collection of molecules that have a fixed set of macroscopic parameters. In the canonical ensemble, the number of particles, temperature, and volume are fixed (NVT condition). The parition function $Q$ is the fundamental quantity that describes the ensemble. For the canonical ensemble, the partition function is\n",

    "    Q(N, V, T) = \\sum_i e^{-E_i(N, V)/k_B T},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $i$ runs over all possible states in the system having energy $E_i$. Thermodynamic parameters can be derived from the partition function as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    U &= k_B T^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\partial {\\rm ln} Q}{\\partial T} \\right )_{N, V} \\\\\n",
    "    H &= U + PV  = k_B T^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\partial {\\rm ln} Q}{\\partial T} \\right )_{N, V} + \n",

    "                  -k_B T {\\rm ln} Q .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "For an ideal gas, the partition function $Q$ can be written in terms of the molecular partition function $q$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    Q = \\frac{q^N}{N!}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of particles and the factor $N!$ accounts for the indistinguishability of the particles. The molecular partition function in the canonical ensemble is given by:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    q = \\sum_k^{\\rm levels} g_k e^{-\\epsilon_k/k_B T},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $g_k$ is the degeneracy of energy level $k$ which has the energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the molecular energy $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be a separable sum of electronic, translational, rotational, and vibrational terms, the molecular partition function $q$ can be written as:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    q = q_{\\rm elec} q_{\\rm trans} q_{\\rm rot} q_{\\rm vib}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Standard expressions for the individual partition functions can be found in physical chemistry textbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining the partition function from quantum chemical calculations requires vibrational frequency calculation for determining the vibrational contribution. The remaining components are easier to compute. Standard quantum chemistry packages print out the thermodynamic analysis after frequency computations. The vibrational zero-point energy contribution to the energy is often significant. Note that the computed thermodynamic quantities here are *absolute* quantities (i.e. relative to infinitely separated electrons and nuclei). These are not the usual heat of formation, which are relative to some standard state."
